# PaceBot

A Discord bot utilizing the therun.gg's API to get the best current pace of any game.

## Setting up as a runner

Setting this up so your pace is displayed is very simple, just follow [this tutorial](https://bit.ly/3KeIxBi) and DM me if you have questions.

Currently the bot is setup in [my personal server](https://discord.com/invite/tXxwrYw) while testing, but it may be added elsewhere in the future.

## Usage

To use this bot you must clone this repo, then update the `config.json` file's variables to your liking.

When hosting you also need to setup some environment variables:
- `DISCORD_SECRET`: Discord bot's auth token
- `TWITCH_CLIENT`: Twitch app client id
- `TWITCH_SECRET`: Twitch app secret token
- `MONGO_URI`: Mongo cluster URI

Feel free to DM me if you have any questions: Specnr#9012
